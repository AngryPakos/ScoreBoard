# ScoreBoard

note: 
topic seems to be more suitable for a webservice than what I'm trying to achieve here.

Is this lib suppose to have a front end?

team's names validation to be specified - so far everything longer than 1 char is ok
	there is no upper limit

many questions about scoring
	can you loose points?
	can you have a half of a point?
	is it worth it to validate vs max int?
	is it possible to have a negative score?
